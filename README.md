Code supporting "Identification of a signature of evolutionarily conserved stress-induced mutagenesis in cancer."
All code is written with the assumption that the associated files are in the working directory unless otherwise indicated in the code. 

Code for figures, except survival curve, is detailed in readme_figure_codebase.md. Code for the survival figure is at the end of Analysis_script_20180709.r. SIM_mechanism_analysis.r has code for the analysis of data from selected and parental cell lines from Cipponi A, Goode DL, Bedo J, McCabe MJ, Pajic M, Croucher DR, et al. MTOR signaling orchestrates stress-induced mutagenesis, facilitating adaptive evolution in cancer. Science. 2020 Jun 5;368(6495):1127â€“31. It also contains code for the mutational signature analysis for all samples.
