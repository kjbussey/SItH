Source data and code to generate plots. 

1. Source `clusters.R` to produce all plots in figure 1, 2 and 3, concerning tuple and cluster distributions as a function of the mutational load, and prevalence of mutational tuples accross the genome (figure 2B)
2. Source `sith.R` to produce figure 4, overal SItH values and cluster SItH IQR values as a function of the mutational load. 
3. Files `clusters.RData` and `sith.RData` are archive R files containing all the necessary source data, parameters and functions required to generate the graphs. The R scripts will lead the data from these files, please keep them in the same location.
